# ESP32-IZ-POC
This repository was created to document all important information and codes about the recreated IZ POC using ESP32 board. Later, not only RSSI (hw) will be used, but also [SCI](https://github.com/espressif/esp-csi). It will be based on the [IZ Codes](https://github.com/Rafaelatff/IZ-codes), but not necessary be placed on IZ again.
